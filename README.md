# Cough-Etiquette

Hello, my name is Paul Leamy (paul.leamy@tudublin.ie). I am a PhD researcher in the School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering at TU Dublin.

As part of my research into the detection of cough sounds in audio signals, I am collecting recordings of coughs from individuals observing different cough etiquette - e.g. covering the mouth with a hand, covering the mouth with an elbow, not covering the mouth at all, and coughing while wearing a mask. The recordings gathered will be made publicly available for download. However, the names of the contributors will not be disclosed.

I am requesting that you submit three audio recordings via this form. The three audio recordings are:

* Recording 1: 5 coughs (real, induced or forced) with hand etiquette - i.e. using your hand to cover your mouth.
* Recording 2: 5 coughs (real, induced or forced) with elbow etiquette - i.e. using your elbow to cover your mouth.
* Recording 3: 5 coughs (real, induced or forced) with no etiquette - i.e. without covering your mouth.
* Recording 4: 5 coughs (real, induced or forced) with **no etiquette and wearing a mask**.

The files should be in WAV format and recorded at 44.1 kHz (either mono or stereo).
There should be a brief pause between coughs.
Background noise should be minimised during recording.

The tool at the following link can be used to record and download files as necessary - https://paulleamy.github.io/cough_cappture2.html

An example of each cough etiquette is demonstrated at this link - https://youtu.be/jTef9stcdMQ

The intention is to make this data available for public use while maintaining the anonymity of the participants. An example of how this data will be shared can be viewed at this link - https://github.com/paulleamy/Cough-Etiquette
