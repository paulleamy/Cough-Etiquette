# Cough-Etiquette

Hello, my name is Paul Leamy (paul.leamy@tudublin.ie). I am PhD researcher in the School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering at TU Dublin.

As part of my research into cough detection in audio signals, I am collecting recordings of cough sounds from individuals observing different cough etiquette e.g. no etiquette, hand etiquette, elbow etiquette. The recordings gathered will be made publicly available to download, however the names, or any other personal details, of the contributors will not be disclosed. 

I am requesting that you submit three audio recordings via this form The three audio recordings are:

Recording 1. 10-15 real/induced/forced coughs with no etiquette (no covering)
Recording 2. 10-15 real/induced/forced coughs with hand etiquette (using hand to cover your mouth)
Recording 3. 10-15 real/induced/forced coughs with elbow etiquette (using elbow to cover your mouth)

The files should be in WAV format and recorded at 44.1 kHz, and the coughs should be separated briefly from each other. Also, there should be little to no background noise present during recording.

An example of the each cough etiquette is demonstrated at this link - https://youtu.be/yM32-TviPLI

The intention is to make this data available for public use while maintaining the anonymity of the participants.

If you are willing to submit recordings and consent to having your data made available can you please indicate on the form (where you can upload too).
